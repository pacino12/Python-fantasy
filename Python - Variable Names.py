# rules for variable names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
"""Legal variable names:"""
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# illegal varible names
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John

# cammel case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"

# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"

# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"
