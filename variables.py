# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

# well python is case sensitive

# A will not overwrite a
# Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values
# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
"""One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

"""

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

"""Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

"""
# Unpack list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
